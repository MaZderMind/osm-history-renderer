/**
 * During the import and update process, nodes are read from the input
 * file. The coordinates from those nodes are stored in-memory for very
 * fast access. During the updated process, information of nodes may be
 * requested that is not contained in the input file. This is done using
 * the DbAdapter.
 *
 * There are several implementations of the Nodestore, as during import
 * it's the main memory consumer and during the import the memory
 * consumption is quite high.
 *
 * Therefore Nodestore is an abstract class, with its main methods being
 * pure virtual.
