How to contribute
=================
Thank you for wanting to contribute! This Project is Open-Source and it lives from People working together.
If you're about to open an Issue, please read the following Section and if you find that it doesn't apply to you, then please go ahead and open an Issue or send in a PR, and I'll happily discuss it with you.


The Issue-Tracker is for Issues with the Software
-------------------------------------------------
It is no Support-Forum to ask for how to build or install a library.
If you open an Issue, attach an reproducible Testcase and an explanation, where exactly the Software does something unexpected and what in your oppinion would be the correct result and why.


I won't explain Linux to you
----------------------------
I will not explain you how to install or build software under Linux. There are tons of tutorials on the Internet. If the obvious ways don't work for you, please search for a local hacker-space and go there, because I will not remote-debug your Package-Management screwup.


I will not help you with $library
---------------------------------
If you have issues with installing or configuring postgres, postgis, libosmium, geos or one of the other libraries involved, please ask there. I have not worked with OSM/Geodata for years and have no knowledge of the recent chages and (in)compatibilities in your particular distribution.
I will happily try to help you with querying the data or analyzing it.


But I'm a Student and have to finish $work
------------------------------------------
Yes, and this is the problem. Over the past 4 years I helped like two dozend students getting a VM up, installing the tools, building up their databases and querying some data.
I have never seen one of them
 - Document their Setup-Procedure
 - Help other Students get their Setup up
 - Publish their Data, their Results or their VM-Images under an Open-Source-Licencse
 - Contribute Code or Features to the OSM-History-Tools

And this is *not* how Open-Source works.

If you write me an E-Mail or open an Issue which requests one of the above, I'll respond/close it with a Link to this Document.
